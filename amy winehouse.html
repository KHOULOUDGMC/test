        Amy Winehouse won five Grammy Awards connected to her 2006 album 'Back to Black,' and is remembered for songs like "Rehab" and "Valerie."
    </p>
    <h2>Who Was Amy Winehouse?</h2>
    <p>Amy Winehouse broke into the music business when, at age 16, a classmate passed on her demo tape to a record label. She signed her first record deal as a jazz vocalist, and her music later blossomed into an eclectic mix of jazz, pop, soul and R&amp;B. Winehouse won five Grammy Awards connected to her 2006 album&nbsp;<em>Back to Black</em>, and earned acclaim for songs like the title track, "Rehab" and "Love Is a Losing Game." Winehouse died tragically on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27 from accidental alcohol poisoning.</p>
    <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
    <p>Amy Jade Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983, in the suburb of Southgate in London, England. Her father, Mitch Winehouse, worked as a cab driver, while mother Janis was employed as a pharmacist. In her early years, Winehouse was immersed in music; many of her uncles on her mother's side were professional jazz musicians, and her father sang as a child with his family. Winehouse's paternal grandmother was also once romantically involved with British jazz legend Ronnie Scott. Winehouse grew up listening to a diverse range of music, from James Taylorto Sarah Vaughan. At the age of 10, she was drawn to listen to American R&amp;B and hip-hop acts, including&nbsp;TLC&nbsp;and&nbsp;Salt-N-Pepa,&nbsp;and she founded a short-lived amateur rap group called Sweet 'n Sour.</p>
    <p>At the age of 12, Winehouse was accepted into the prestigious Sylvia Young Theatre School, and a year later she received her first guitar. But by the age of 16, Winehouse was expelled for "not applying herself" and piercing her nose. That same year, she caught her first big break when a schoolmate and close friend, pop singer Tyler James, passed her demo tape to his label, A&amp;R, who was searching for a jazz vocalist. The opportunity led her to a record deal with Island/Universal.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Debut Album: 'Frank'</h3>
    <p>Her debut album,&nbsp;<em>Frank</em>&nbsp;(2003), was a critically acclaimed mixture of jazz, pop, soul and hip-hop. The album was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize as well as two BRIT awards for Best Female Solo Artist and Best Urban Act. The debut single on the album, "Stronger Than Me," earned the new artist an Ivor Novello award.&nbsp;<em>Frank</em>&nbsp;also hit double platinum status.</p>

    <p>During this time, Winehouse began developing a reputation as an unstable party girl, often showing up to her club or TV performances too drunk to sing a whole set. She also started a tumultuous, on-again-off-again relationship with music video assistant Blake Fielder-Civil who admitted to introducing Winehouse to hard drugs. In public, the couples' arguments often devolved into fistfights and dramatic scenes. In private, their romance centered around drugs, alcohol and physical abuse.</p>
    <h3>'Back to Black'</h3>
    <p>By 2006, her management company finally suggested that Winehouse enter rehab for alcohol abuse. Instead, she dumped the company and turned the experience into the lead single for her second, critically acclaimed album&nbsp;<em>Back to Black</em>&nbsp;(2006). The song "Rehab," which addressed her refusal to receive treatment for substance abuse, became a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom and earned the artist another Ivor Novello award for best contemporary song. The album was also a critical success, winning the artist a BRIT award for Best Female Solo Artist and a BRIT nomination for Best British Album in 2007.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Marriage and Erratic Behavior</h2>
<p>In April 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were engaged. Winehouse revealed that her romance with the 23-year-old was the inspiration for several of the&nbsp;<em>Back to Black</em>&nbsp;tracks. The couple eloped and married on May 18, 2007, in a ceremony in Miami, Florida.</p>
<p>Winehouse, an admitted marijuana smoker, was dogged by reports of continued drug abuse and strange behavior. On August 8, 2007, the singer overdosed on several drugs and was hospitalized. First claiming exhaustion, Winehouse later told the&nbsp;<em>News of the World</em>&nbsp;that she overdosed after she had used a mix of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine, whisky and vodka during a bar crawl in London. The episode put a planned tour of North America on hold. The August 21, 2007, announcement indicated that Winehouse had been ordered to rest and was working with doctors to address her health.</p>
<h2>More Personal Setbacks</h2>
<p>Despite her musical success, Winehouse's health and personal life began to quickly deteriorate. Her erratic behavior continued in June 2008, when she appeared to punch a fan during a performance at the Glastonbury Music Festival in England. Londoner James Gostelow, 25, told&nbsp;<em>BBC News</em>&nbsp;that Winehouse elbowed him in the forehead after someone in the crowd behind him threw a hat at her. In a widely circulated video of the incident, Winehouse was seen throwing a series of punches into the crowd. Gostelow said he had no intention of making a complaint to police, and Winehouse escaped criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>After the concert, Winehouse returned to a London clinic, where she had been receiving treatment for "traces of emphysema" and an irregular heartbeat caused by smoking crack cocaine and cigarettes. Winehouse's father told reporters that his daughter was warned that she would have to wear an oxygen mask if she didn't stop abusing drugs. That same month, Fielder-Civil and three co-defendants pleaded guilty to assault and obstruction charges. The courts released Fielder-Civil from jail time on the condition that he stay in a drug rehabilitation center for long-term treatment.</p>
<p>By the end of 2008, the singer's marriage had dissolved. Winehouse had begun an extended stay on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, during which time she had allegedly met a new love interest. And tabloids had linked Fielder-Civil to German model Sophie Schandorff. In January 2009, Winehouse's spokesperson confirmed that divorce proceedings had begun between husband and wife, with Fielder-Civil filing for divorce and citing adultery as the reason for the split.</p>
<h2>Attempted Comeback</h2>
<p>Regardless of personal setbacks, 2009 proved to be another strong year for Winehouse. In 2008, her album&nbsp;<em>Back to Black</em>&nbsp;was declared the second-highest selling album in the world, and in 2009, she earned entry into the&nbsp;<em>Guinness Book of World Records</em>&nbsp;for "Most Grammy Awards Won by a British Female Act."</p>
<p>Additionally, Winehouse announced that she was starting her own record label, Lioness Records, later signing her 13-year-old goddaughter, Dionne Bromfield, as the first musician on the label.</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>Sadly, at the end of her life, Winehouse's enormous talent was overshadowed by her addiction to drugs and alcohol. The singer died tragically&nbsp;on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27 from accidental alcohol poisoning.</p>
